            <h2>Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
             JavaScript is a popular and versatile programming language used primarily for web development.
             It is a lightweight and interpreted language that allows developers to add dynamic behavior to websites, 
             making them interactive and responsive to user actions.

            <h2>Key points of JavaScript</h2>
            Client-side scripting: JavaScript runs directly in a user's web browser, enabling it to manipulate webpage elements, handle user input, and modify the page content without the need for constant server communication.<br>

Highly flexible: JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple animations and form validation to complex web applications and games.<br>

Event-driven: JavaScript responds to events like clicks, keypresses, or page loads, allowing developers to trigger specific actions or functions when these events occur.<br>

Object-oriented: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, allowing developers to create reusable code using objects and classes.<br>

Extensive ecosystem: It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which simplify the development process and make it easier to build sophisticated web applications.<br>

Server-side development: With Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development, allowing developers to build entire web applications using the same language on both client and server sides.<br>

Compatibility: Almost all modern web browsers support JavaScript, making it accessible and widely used across different platforms.<br>

            <h2>variables and data types in javascript</h2>
            In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manipulate data. 
            They act as containers that hold values, and these values can be of different types. 
            JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, which means you do not need to declare the data type explicitly when defining a variable. 
            Instead, the data type is determined automatically based on the value assigned to the variable.<br><br>
            <b>Variables:</b><br>
            To create a variable in JavaScript, you can use the var, let, or const keyword. The var keyword was traditionally used, but now it is recommended to use let and const due to their more predictable behavior.<br><br>
            <b>let</b><br>
            Using let: It allows you to define a variable that can be reassigned to a different value.<br>
            <em>let age = 25;<br>
            let name = "John";<br></em><br>
            <b>const</b><br>
            Using const: It creates a variable with a constant value that cannot be reassigned once initialized.<br>
            <em>const pi = 3.14;<br>
            const appName = "My App";</em><br><br>

            Data Types:<br>
            JavaScript has several primitive data types and a reference data type:<br><br>

            Primitive Data Types:<br><br>

            Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.<br>
            String: Represents sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.<br>
            Boolean: Represents true or false values, which are often used in conditional statements.<br>
            Null: Represents an intentional absence of any value.<br>
            Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.<br>
            Symbol: Represents unique and immutable values, often used as object property keys.<br><br>

            Reference Data Type:<br>
            <br>
            Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs and complex data structures.<br>
            Array: Represents an ordered collection of elements.<br>
            Function: Represents a reusable block of code that can be executed.<br>
        </section>
        <section id="expression">
            <h2>Expression</h2>
            Expression is a combination of operator and operands.<br>
            It can be a arithematic operation for a result which is stored or displayed in console (console.log).<br>
            Example: sum=a+b;

        </section>
        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            In conclusion, JavaScript's flexibility, ease of use, and widespread adoption have made it a cornerstone of modern web development. Whether you are creating simple interactive elements or building complex web applications, JavaScript remains an essential tool for developers worldwide. As technology advances, JavaScript is likely to continue evolving and powering innovative web experiences in the future.
